### Step 1

#### Edit

Write a module `basicmath.py` with functions to add, subtract, multiply and divide two values.

Write a script that uses this module [^import] and call some functions of this module.

[^import]:
    You can import this using `import`

#### Run

Run this script.

### Step 2

#### Edit

Write a second module `stringopts.py` an group this and the first one in a Package.[^package]
`stringopts` should include functions that are called `get_length`, `reverse`[^reverse] and `does_include`

[^package]:
    Do not forget to add a `__init__.py`

[^reverse]:
    To reverse Strings you could use `myString[::-1]` or `reversed(myString)`

Edit your script and use functions of both.

#### Run

Run and test you script.
